      (born December 18, 2001) is an American singer-songwriter. She first
      gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single "Ocean Eyes", which
      was subsequently released by Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records.
      It was written and produced by her brother, Finneas O'Connell, with whom
      she collaborates on music and live shows. Her commercially successful
      debut EP Don't Smile at Me (2017) charted in the top 15 in numerous
      countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

      Eilish's first studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?
      (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one
      of the best-selling albums of 2019, buoyed by the success of its fifth
      single, "Bad Guy", Eilish's first number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100.
      The following year, she co-wrote and performed the theme song "No Time to
      Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK Singles
      Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. Her
      subsequent singles "Everything I Wanted", "My Future", "Therefore I Am",
      and "Your Power" peaked in the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second studio
      album, Happier Than Ever (2021), reached number one in 25 countries.
