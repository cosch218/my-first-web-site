      (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and record
      producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song
      videos uploaded to YouTube. Puth initially signed with the record label
      eleveneleven after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, while
      songwriting and producing for other artists. With primary intent on a solo
      career, Atlantic Records and Artist Partner Group eventually sought the
      artist, and he released his debut single, "Marvin Gaye" (featuring Meghan
      Trainor), in 2015.

      He was then featured on the single "See You Again", which he co-wrote,
      co-produced, and performed with Atlantic label-mate Wiz Khalifa for the
      Furious 7 soundtrack as a tribute to actor Paul Walker. The song peaked at
      number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, was
      certified 11Ã— Platinum by the RIAA, and earned him a Golden Globe Award
      for Best Original Song nomination, along with three nominations at the
      58th Annual Grammy Awards, including one for Song of the Year. After the
      success of "See You Again", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple
      subsequent releases, including his next single, "One Call Away". The
      single reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.
