            (born 19 May 1992) is an English singer and songwriter. After rising to
            prominence in October 2012 by featuring on Disclosure's breakthrough
            single "Latch", which peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart,
            they were subsequently featured on Naughty Boy's "La La La", which
            became a number one single in May 2013. In December 2013, Smith was
            nominated for the 2014 Brit Critics' Choice Award and the BBC's Sound of
            2014 poll, winning both.

            Smith's debut studio album, In the Lonely Hour, was released in May 2014
            on Capitol Records UK. The album's lead single, "Lay Me Down", was
            released prior to "La La La". The album's second single, "Money on My
            Mind", became their second number one single in the UK. The third
            single, "Stay with Me", was internationally successful, reaching number
            one in the UK and number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, while subsequent
            singles "I'm Not the Only One" and "Like I Can" reached the top ten in the
            UK. The album won four awards, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, including
            Best Pop Vocal Album, Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the
            Year, and nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
