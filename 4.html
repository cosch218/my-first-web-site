      (born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. She
      started her career as a singer in the acid jazz band Crisp in the
      mid-1990s in Adelaide. In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her
      debut studio album, titled OnlySee, in Australia. She moved to London and
      provided vocals for the British duo Zero 7. Sia released her second studio
      album, Healing Is Difficult, in 2001, and her third, Colour the Small One,
      in 2004.

      Sia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the United States. Her
      fourth and fifth studio albums, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are
      Born, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified
      gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association and attracted wider
      notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia
      took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other
      artists, producing successful collaborations "Titanium" (with David
      Guetta), "Diamonds" (with Rihanna) and "Wild Ones" (with Flo Rida).
